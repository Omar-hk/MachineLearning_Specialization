# MachineLearning_Specialization Journey Process

Thats My Andrew ng Machine Learning Specialization Course Progress such as (assignment, projects ,etc) 


in the first Course i've finished two coding assignments with two mini-projects

# the first Assignment (Week 2)

it was implementition for linear regression with one variable to predict profits for a restaurant franchise.


# the second Assignment (Week 3)

it was implementition for logistic regression and apply it to two different datasets.

# C_1 Finished

not yet....Because i decided to do another project in my own


# Project_1 

i want to do a project with scikit-learn because It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support-vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means

and ofcourse i will need this library in the real-world jobs so i want to learn it more in practice

so i did a logistic regression model to solve a classification problem and i used "Iris Dataset"

and now i'm trying to improve the model and learn from the progress 

you can find the notebook and the other stuff in (Projects)
